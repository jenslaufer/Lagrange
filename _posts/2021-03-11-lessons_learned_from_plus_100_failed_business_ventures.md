# x Lessons learned from 100+ failed business ventures

I am a 51 years old german freelancing software- and machine learning engineer, who started over the course of 25 years more than 100 businesses.

It all started with the link list "Kaufrausch" (="shopping rush" in English) with online shops in Germany in the beginning of the commercial internet around 1995; today you would call a website like that a portal. There were around 20 shops in whole Germany, Altavista and Yahoo were still the dominant search engines. Domain names and hosting were expensive, so I bought laufer-online.com (the website's address was laufer-online.com/kaufrausch) instead of kaufrausch.de, which was a stupid. I even made it into some third class book about internet visionaires in Germany. The business was a fail, because it was difficult to earn money on the internet at that time. My problem was also that I was an introverted person, full of social anxiety. Instead of phoning companies to earn money with banner ads I was focusing on the technical stuff. Technology was more difficult than today, marketing on the other hand was super easy as there was no competition.

After that fail I had a ton of other ideas, some were brilliant, others were stupid and funny. I started to place affiliate lins

- apthenbehandlung (bad example)
- selling airbnb reports
- selling cheat sheets
- Placing 800,000 booking.com affiliate links on google maps
- I wrote an e-book about porn addiction

Some ideas are still in the pipeline. I can share them, as I won't ever touch them. Where is the app where all people automatically upload their photos on a event like a wedding?
I guess data compliance is a problem. Some content creators have a high quality content and an audience but struggle to earn money. Others have a product, but still struggle to get in front of customers, because they don't have an audience. they don't build up credibilty. Where is the platform that makes the connection.

The only successful "business" I started until today is my freelancing business, although I am not even call it a business, because I swap my time for money. That's a same like being somebody in a permanent job in my eyes. What makes a real business is the fact that it's automated and scalable.

You might 4stop reading, because you want to learn from the successful people. Why should you read something from a loser (I don't see me like that)? However, some Gurus are often not Gurus and the real successful people forget about their own problems on the path. Some of them even care about you, why should they.

### Marketing, Marketing, Marketing... and Marketing

Forget about product development. If you are not able to get your product in front of your target customers you are a fail. **Learn marketing before you learn anything else. Fullstop.**
In my opinion is learning marketing is 100x more difficult to learning technical.

### Get out the building

"Get out of the building" is a stated by Steve Blank. It means that you start executing shortly after you had your idea, You meet your customers, learn from them. learn about getting customers (marketing

### content sucks

### content is the king

### stop lying

In older articles I was pretending that I am business guru. Now I am 100% honest, the stuff I have to say still matters somehow.

## Stop dreaming, execution matters

Forget about ideas. At around 2000 I worked for a internet startup. Website is down, but I found [this discussion](http://www.emaildiscussions.com/showthread.php?t=29569). The website was a portal you could send emails,sms, fax and snail mail.
My friend had the idea to connect the users with each other (the "buddy list"). Our users loved it. Shortly before we were running out of money, we had a business meeting with our investors. I suggested to put more effort on the "buddy list".
The people in the meeting nodded, and they were just ignoring what I said. It was the first time I said something in a meeting. I felt dead stupid. However, before you call me the German Zuckerberg, I am sure at the same time several Zuckerbergs had the same idea. However, only the real Zuckerberg invented Facebook. So forget

Forget about product development first.

### Dream more

Hanging around and dream of live as an entrepreneur makes you an idea machine. I am still a day dreamer today. My best ideas come up while I am lost in dreaming. Be the person you want to be and the ideas pop up in a continous stream

### The good about failing, you learn a ton of (micro)skills

Everything I know today is from my hunt for an own business

## Learn to write

## Learn to program

## Learn to digg in the data

## Learn to work

## Learn to outsource

### Learn to see the opportunities in the daily noise

Paypal wanted to make businees with Mailsurf. working in pyjamas. My friend "I don't want to fly to america". However, Paypal was a smaller than we have been. Most probably there were other companies contacting us. On the other hand was papal looking for websites as viral vehicle.

### Good business ideas are often boring

My friend owns several houses and is multimillionaire. He still is a bad programmer, makes ugly webpages, doesn't know anything about marketing.

Yes, I am a fail, but maybe they were right, but I am visionary

### there are easier paths for financial independence than having your own business

## Final words

I wrote this article to get rid of my frustration, because I failed with some marketing effort for a new idea. While writing the article I got reminded to the website [FuckedCompany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fucked_Company). It was founded by Phillip Kaplan, who worked for several
failed startups during the dot.com bubble. Instead of having proper salaries he had shares in the companies that were worth nothing at the end. He founded FuckedCompany as site for employees to share rumors about their companies, but also comments about unethitical managers, defective products. He sold rumor listings to subscribers like investors. With the site he made more money than working startup especially before the dot.com bubble bursted.

I am having the idea to create a little bit different business community. In the community I want to share my ideas, my anxious moments, my learnings. Everybody else can do the same. It's maybe a place of vulneriabilty where we allowed to laugh about our fails. The place for finding the most stupid ideas to find finally genious ideas.

There is the business tipp that you should surround yourself only the best of the breed to succeed. I am tired of these business tipps you read 10x times a day. I believe, that you sometimes you have surround yourself with big fails to learn. The most intelligent person in the room is not always the best teacher.

Me as visionary idea machine marketing fail hope to meet in the group the marketing god who is an idea dumbo. This is called synergy.
