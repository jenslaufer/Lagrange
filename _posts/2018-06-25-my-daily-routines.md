I optimized lately my daily routines to be more focused on my work and projects.


### 06:00am Waking up

I am always getting up at the same time, even at the weekends, as I am not a good sleeper. I try to get 5 sleep cycles of 1.5 hours.

I was inspired by the book  of Nick Littlewhales who is the sleep coach of Christiano Ronaldo and other sportsmen.
[Sleep: The Myth of 8 Hours, the Power of Naps... and the New Plan to Recharge Your Body and Mind](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B01ISFAU1W/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)
