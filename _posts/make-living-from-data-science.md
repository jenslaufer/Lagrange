You made yourself a plan.

You want to make a living from Data Science

Well, why are you applying for a data science job then? 
There are tons of them right now.

You tell me that you want to create a __valuable, repeatable and scalable business model__ and you don't want to trade time for money. 

I tell you, that you could search for startups that are looking for a data science co-founder.

You tell me, that you don't want that.  You want rather build up a small bootstraped business on your own without investors.

Ok, things are getting more difficult now. I think you are a bit crazy. But I am a friendly person



### 1. Data Science Courses

This is one of the most obviuous thing. you could just build Data science courses on platforms like udemy. ([Matt Dancho](https://www.business-science.io/about.html) is a good example about somebody who does exactly this). I could make courses about the stuff I know and offer it on platforms like Udemy.

### 2. Payed APIs to Machine Learning Models

This is very interesting. 
I trained a neural network last year that is able to quantify image aesthetics. (Check my article[Image aesthetics quantification with a convolutional neural network (CNN)](https://jenslaufer.com/machine/learning/image-aesthetics-quantification-with-a-convolutional-neural-network.html))

Website with custom uploaded product image must all have the problem that they want to rpush products with better photos on top, as it looks more professionell. I think there must be big market for this.

### 3. Market Analysises

There are a lot of opportunities with this. [AirDna](https://airdna.co) offers market analysis for Airbnb hosts and people, who wants to invest in Airbnb property. [ViralLaunch](https://viral-launch.com) or [JungleScout](https://junglescout.com) offer analysis for people who want to start a Amazon shop.

### 4. Selling Data

I could sell data sets you collected before. I could get images in a specific domain and label these images with Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) or label it automatically with a machine learning algorithm. Maybe I could build up a image dataset with it. This sounds easier as it is, as there might be legal issues with photos which are the intellectual property of somebody else.

### 5. Data Journalism

I do data storytelling and sell stories. The question is: Does this scale?



I wrote this story to myself to train my writing muscle and to brainstorm ideas. I limited time to 50 minutes.

Have you more ideas
