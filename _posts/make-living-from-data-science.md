You made yourself a plan.

You want to make a living in Data Science.

Well, why are you applying for a data science job then?
There are tons of them right now, as we all know data science is hot right now.

You tell me that you want to create a __valuable, repeatable and scalable business model__ and you don't want to trade time for money. 

I tell you that you could search for startups that are looking for a data science co-founder. Again, there are many opportunities right now.

You tell me that you don't want that.  You want instead build up a small bootstrapped business with NO con-founders and NO investors.

I think you are difficult and the idea is a bit crazy. However, the more I think about, the more I think the idea is brilliant.

Let's brainstorm data science product ideas you could do as a solopreneur.

We even created a new word for this kind of business.

### 1. Data Science Courses

Let's start with the most obvious idea. You can offer Data Science courses on platforms like [Udemy](https://udemy.com) or on your own website. That's what many people are already doing right now. 

[Matt Dancho](https://www.business-science.io/about.html) is a good example about somebody who does exactly this. I am connected with him and I love the posts about his courses on LinkedIn.

Although there are so many data science courses these days, there are always opportunities by niching down.

### 2. Paid APIs to Machine Learning Models

You can train a fancy neural network on labeling images for a specific domain. You publish an  API and let pay customers for using the API. This seem more difficult than it is. There are many free data sets out there you can use for training models. You even don't need much data, if you use transfer learning techniques.

### 3. Market Analysis

There are a lot of opportunities with this. [AirDna](https://airdna.co) offers market analysis for Airbnb hosts and people, who wants to invest in Airbnb property. They offer also a pricing engine. 

[ViralLaunch](https://viral-launch.com) or [JungleScout](https://junglescout.com) offer analysis for people who want to start a Amazon shop.

Why not start something like this? There are platforms out there.

What's about market analysis for [Uber](https://uber.com)?

### 4. Selling Data

There is huge demand for data sets. You can collect data and label this data with Amazon Mechanical Turks (AMT). This can be more difficult than it sounds and needs big investment of time or/and money. You can also run into legal issues with collecting e.g images that are the intellectual property of somebody else.

### 5. Data Journalism

I do data storytelling and sell stories. The question is: Does this scale?

## Conclusion

There are opportunities for data science products for solopreneurs. You need other skills besides data science like marketing or sales to be realistic. However you mastered data science, you will master those as well.

_I wrote this story to myself to brainstorm ideas and train my writing muscle._

_Another idea that came up while writing this story was to create a new publication on Medium "The Data Science Solopreneur"._
