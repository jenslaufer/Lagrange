In 2006 I started the development of an Unified Messaging Server as a side project; with the server you were able to send out messages via E-Mail, SMS, Letters and Fax. The software was quiet flexible by using a problin concpet. The goal was to sell the software to companies. The project was great as it took my software skills to a new level, because I learned many new technologies and libraries. 
I always had ideas for improvement, so after six years the product was still not finished. I started to do some marketing in 2012 to finally notice there was no demand for a server like this. The project wasn't a complete waste of time, as I earned money a lot of money with the skills I adapted in the project. However, I never reached the goal of having my own scalable product. Luckilly I didn't spend any money on the project. Most probably it would have ruined me.

In case you want to start to start your own business don't fall into the same trap like me. In this article I want tell why it's important to build minimal viable products (MVP) to valiadte your ideas.

### 1. You reduce the financial risk

### 2. You save time

### 3. Marketing and Sales is part of the game

Especially as developer you think that a great product sells by itself. That might happen from time to time. However, most products fail and you lose a lot of time (and money) with this approach. Marketing and Sales are essential parts of the process to start a business. You have to show the world that your product exists and you have to be able to sell it.

Honestly, in case you are not able to get your marketing and sales right you are not a business woman/man. That is a bitter truth. You might think that you can outsource this, but do you think it is important to hand something like this to somebody else who doesn't have the same passion like you have. 

The good news is that you can learn maketing and sales. Try do visualize your target customers and learn where you can find them. Show them your minimal viable products.


### 4. You find the best idea
