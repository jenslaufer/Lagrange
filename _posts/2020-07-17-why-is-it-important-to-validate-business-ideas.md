In 2006 I started the development of an Unified Messaging Server as a side project; with the server you were able to send out messages via E-Mail, SMS, Letters and Fax. The software was quiet flexible by using a plugin concept for the different channels. My goal was to sell the software to companies. It was a great project as it took my software skills to a new level; I learned so many new technologies, libraries and design patterns.
I always had ideas for improvement, so after six years the product was still not finished. I started to do some marketing in 2012 to finally notice there was no demand for a sofware like this. The project wasn't a complete waste of time, as I earned money with the skills I acquired in the project. However, I never reached the goal of having my own scalable product with it. Luckilly I just spend my time on the project and no money money. Otherwise it would have ruined me.

In case you want to start to start your own business don't fall into the same trap like me. In this article I want tell why it's important to build minimal viable products (MVP) to validate your business ideas.

### 1. You reduce the financial risk

Guess of a great business idea you are in love with. You are sure it's a once in a lifetime opportunity. Unfortunatly you cannot produce the product by yourself, so you actually need a team of people you must pay for. Maybe you have some savings to pay the team members or you apply for a loan. But that doesn't seem a big problem since you are sure you will 
make a lot of money with your business.

Over the next months you develop the product with a lot of passion, which feels quiet well. You kept your business idea as a secret till the day you are finished with it. Finally launch day is there, but nobody wants the product. After trying every marketing hack in the world you finally give up. Now you realize that you have a lot of debt. You have a new
business idea in mind, but you cannot start the project, because you are financially not in the position to go for idea.

Something like this happens to many entrepreneurs. You can avoid this by building a simple minimal viable product (MVP). This can be a sketch, a website mockup, a Powerpoint presentation or simple form with a value proposition in a first iteration. You can show this to a few target customers and get their feedback. Sometimes these customers open their wallets in this early stage already, which is a very good sign. In the next iteration you head a bit more to the final product with the goal to show the product again to the customers you aquired in the first iteration. In each iteration you can aquire more and more customers. This way you can also learn which marketing channels work and which not. At some point you also try to get the customers pay for your product, although it's not finished yet. In case you are on the wrong track you can always pivot. The iterative way reduces your financial risk, since you focus early also on marketing and sales.


### 2. You save time

When we have a business idea we often fall in love with it. We develop a future vision for it. In our mind 
we develop products we want to sell, which is normally not something bad. However, we often tend to start product development right away, which takes a lot of effort and time. What we forget is that starting a business is more than product development; there are other elements that make a successful business. What does a great product help, when you cannot sell it?

Therefore it's important to focus on all parts of what makes a business from the beginning. This way you
work more efficient, you save time, because you ensure that the business as a whole is working. If it's not working out, you can stop to follow the idea. You can change  it or do something else.

But how can you focus on all parts? Isn't even more work instead of less? No, by building tiny minimal viable products (MVP) you save a lot of time. The art is to build the right product: The goal is to deliver the most value with minmal effort. However, it's also possible to sell a vision by products sketches or presentation like mentioned before.


### 3. Marketing and Sales is part of the game

Many people think that a great product sells by itself. That might happen from time to time. However, most products fail and you lose a lot of time and money with the approach of developing the final product. Marketing and Sales are essential parts of the process of starting a business. You must be able to show the world that your product exists and you have to be able to sell it.

Honestly, in case you are not able to get your marketing and sales right you are not a business woman/man. That is a bitter truth. You might think that you can outsource this, but do you think it is important to hand something like this to somebody else who doesn't have the same passion like you have? I think it's not a good idea.

The good news is that you can learn maketing and sales. Try do visualize your target customers, what there typically day is and learn where you can find them. 

Talk to these customers and show them your product vision, demos, mockups or simple first versions of your product. 

Your focus must be to learn as much as possible in the shortest amount of time.



### 4. You find the best idea

Maybe you are in the lucky situation that you have many business ideas.
In that case you have the problem to find out which of this ideas is the most promising one. It takes most probably the whole life to try them all out, your financial situation is another limiting factor. By building simple Minimal Viavle Products (MVP) and some marketing effort you can try them all out.

You could build a landing page with a value proposition and order button without 
even having the product. You can easily setup a low budget ad campaign on Google, Facebook or other websites where your target customers are hanging around. Then you check how many orders you can get. For sure you pay the customers the money back for their orders, because you cannot deliver them something. You can tell them you are out of stock. It's important to follow this approach with a different brand/domain name as you don't want hurt your final brand. The goal is to get insights: Does your (not existing) product sell, are you able to aquire customers. You can also try out different pricing points.
