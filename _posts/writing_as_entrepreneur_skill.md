# Get out of the building  and the most undervalued Skill of Entrepreneurs

> Get out of Building, Steve Blank

As an entrreprenuer you have to get out Building with your products and services.

Founders build websites today within minutes, craft a MVP (minimal viable product) in
AI  on self scaling fancy Kubernetes Cluster that can scale to multi million users within days. Technology is what matters to them and there eyes . UX and design matters.

However they forget one essential part: The Words. 

They don't fill the empty pages with right words writen with passion. They fill them with stupid headline one of the founders wrote while sitting on the toilet. They think they can hire a cheap copywriter on Fiverr.

The One of the most important skill as and  entrepreneur is:

__W R I T I NG__

It's the headlines which attract people. It's the right words in the message on LinkedIn that lets somebody  the invest into your products. It's compelling story in your blog that's a prospect to a loyal user.

It's about you finding the right words, as you have the vision for your products. If you are not able to do it you need a high-quality writer with passion for your niche. You won't get that writer for nothing less the cost of a programmer or designer.

Here is my offer for you.

I have nothing to offer. You might think I am low writer who wants to pitch himself now.

Suprise, Surprise  I am techincal entrepreneur with a softwareengieering and data science background struggling to find the right words and fill the empty pages.

I am writing since a few months now and I love it actually.
I learned on this journey that it's essential to write on your websites about your products, pitch the articles to forums. Craft landing pages for your products. Learn to transform product features into benefits. If you don't have ideas for at least 20 articles you maybe have not enough passion for your niche.

So, learn to fill the empty page with words. It's fun. You learn a lot about your own business idea and you can help your prospects from day 1. Make the people happy and teach them something to solve their problems. They will trust you. If you are doing a good job these people will be the herd of the most loyal customers you can think of. 
Your writing must done with passion and glaubhaft ehrlich. There is no short-cut with low quality content. I make writing my daily habit.






So fill the damn empty pages with the right words, tell your stories that make you unique. Improve your prospects live with your articles. The better your writing the credabilty you build up.

i started writing a few month ago and I enjoy it. 

I always wanted to write and was reading about it, because I think it's an essential skill to everybody.

I am an entrepreneur with a technical background in software development and data science . 
Writing is completly underestimated as entreprneur skill but also for software development and data science.

A technical entrepreneur owuld concenrate on the selection of programming language, code quality, the business model. The talk about design of the web page and UX.

__NOBODY__ is saying one word about writing, because everybody thinks he can write.

In the meantime it's in my opinion the most essential and important thing for entrepreneurs from day one.

If you a bit of an expereience you will craft a website with a domain within minutes. You build a fancy MVP within days. You feel proud on your skill.

But the damn page is still empty. You know content marketing is important and it's part of strategy. You think it's the easy part to write some blog posts on your page.
But you procastinate, as you want to concentrate on the difficult part of programming.

The pages on the website are still blank.

Finally you need to fill the pages, as empty pages won't sell you anything.

You have to find the Words about your world-changing product. You think it's easys but then you notice how difficult it is. It's not about finding some words, it's about finding the right word, the craftmanship of finding short sentence. 

You write your first your blog post, which are boring. 

Are you still arrogant about writing.
