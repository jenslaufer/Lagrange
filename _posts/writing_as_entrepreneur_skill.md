> Get out of Building

As an entrepreneur, you have to get out of the building with your products and services as early as possible.

Founders build websites today within minutes. They craft a Minimal Viable Product in
Artificial Intelligence in the cloud that can scale to multi-million users within days. Technology is what matters to entrepreneurs the most. UX and design issues matters a bit.

However, they forget one essential part: The words.

They don't fill the empty pages on their websites with words which are written with passion. Instead, they publish boring headlines they created between two business meetings. They hire a cheap copywriter on Fiverr for $18.50.

They miss one of the most essential skill of an entrepreneur:

The headline on the landing page is what attracts people. 
The right words in the message on LinkedIn lets somebody invest in your business. 
Compelling stories in your blog transforms a prospect to a loyal user.

Writing is essenetial for your business. If you are not able to write yourself you need a high-quality writer with knowledge and passion for your niche.
The bad news: You won't get that writer for less than the cost of an engineer.

You might think I am a writer who wants to pitch himself now.

It might surprise you, but I am an entrepreneur with a software engineering and data science background who struggles to fill the empty pages with the right words like you.

I am writing for a few months now, and I love it.  I am learning on my journey that it's essential to write articles peopple can sol, pitch the articles on forums,
build landing pages for your products. Learn to transform product features into benefits. 
I learned that ff you don't have ideas for at least 50 blog posts, you maybe have not enough passion for your business.

Learn to fill the empty page with words. It's fun. You learn a lot about your own business idea, and you can help your prospects from day 1. Deliver value and teach the customer in your domain how to solve their problems. They will trust you if you deliver your best work. If you are doing a good job, these people will be the herd of the most loyal customers you can think of.

So fill the empty pages with your stories!
