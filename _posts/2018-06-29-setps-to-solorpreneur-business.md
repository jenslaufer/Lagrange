It's 10 am and I am sitting on the balcony of a villa I  recently rented on Airbnb looking into a beautiful garden while writing this blog post. I arrived here a few days ago from my business trip from Hong Kong. I want to relax a bit before heading to a conference in Singapore. I feel happy, because it's the end of the month and my products made another 30k...

OK, I feel guilty! You caught me on lying... The photo doesen't look like Bali. The cherries on the table look sweet, but they are sour.  
The garden is in a bad condition and I am not owning the house. I am frustrated, frustrated about my live as an entrepreneur: I struggle and fail. But hold on, **before stop reading you will get a more realistic picture**:

Everything is not that bad. Yes, I am sitting on a couch and I enjoy it. I worked this morning a few hours on my freelance job as software developer for Volkswagen for a high rate. This morning phoned me two recruiters for jobs in Java development. 
I rent out an apartment that I really own on Airbnb. The rental income covers the rent of the house.
The other day I got three orders for my Airbnb Market Report I sell on fiverr.com, I have a permanent revenue stream from affiliate programs on booking.com and AliExpress. It's just a few bucks, but completely on autopilot. I am able to pick up the kids from school and Kindergarden. We have a cleaning although I also wish to have gardener.

So everything is not perfect, but it's a beginning. I will tell you my steps I go through.


## 1. It's time for passion

**Be aware what your passions are, what you love to do and what you are good at.**

Take a sheet of paper and brainstorm!

List your passions:

   - Football
   - Programing
   - Watching movies on Netflix
   - Dogs

List what you are good at:

   - Programing
   - Statistics
   - Being creative

Is there stuff you are good at and it's your passion. Maybe you can monetize it.

Even if you never start a business you can learn a lot about yourself.

## 2. Be a dectective

The web is full of websites where you can find business opportunities. On these sites people answer questions, leave comments, order products, share stuff and some websites order tools to sell ads. Different metrics are published to help the user to decide what to order or what content is popular. 

Do you need examples?

## 3. Validate the idea with a MVP (Minimal Viable Product)
