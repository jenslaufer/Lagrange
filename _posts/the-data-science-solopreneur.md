If you travel around you meet more and more solopreneurs or digitalm nomads. We are data science. Is it possible to make a living as solopreneur digital nomad. I think yes. To be honest I am not a digital nomad, as I have family. But I try to build up a setup where I can work indepnently of the location. You need to create products for this, in our case data products. Is this realistic. Again a yes. You can create simple products. Today its very easy to deploy such products on cloud servives like AWS or Azure without having your own infrastructure. You dont need your own infrastrcuture for and you easily scale the appiclation while you grow. I created some simple data products which I sell on fiverr and I am just starting a more complex product with convolutional neural network for image aesthetics qunatification.
