My internet journey started about 25 years ago, when I had to write an assignment at the university. Because I didn't have my own computer, I worked at a computer room at the university. During that time they installed browsers for the world wide web on machines. For next days I stopped working on the assignment, instead I was browsing the web and started to learn HTML. I was sure that the Internet would change the world and this would be the kind of work I want to do for the rest of my life. A few weeks later I had link collection of shops that you could order stuff on the web. At that time there were just a few of them. It actually became big with many page views, however I didn't make any cent, because I was not a businessmen. Over the next years I had many other brilliant ideas, however, another problem was that I was dreamer instead of a hustler. The lesson I learned from that:

__STOP DREAMING, TAKE ACTION AND LEARN TO MONETIZE__

Your business idea might be very brillant, but an idea is worth nothing. You have to learn to create a working business and this takes a lot of effort. The risk of a failure is big, so you have to reduce the risk. In this short article I want to show the steps to make your dream real.

### 1. Validate the idea

To reduce the risk for failure you should always validate your idea. Build a mini-product with just a few features, try to get the mini-product in front of your customers. the most important is to learn in this phase:

- Who are my customers?
- Where are my cutomers hanging around?
- What price can I charge?
- What product features do the customers need?
