title: About me
---


Born in 1970 I am child of the seventies. That time was different than today:
Kids were rather playing outsite than insite, there were no smartphones, tablets or playstations and the TV program started not before 5pm (at least in Germany).

My daily routine at that time besides school was daydreaming, reading and doing my own little statistics about football.

The daydreaming was about starting businesses, being a famous football player, poltician, rock star, detective... Today I'd say that the daydreaming pushed my creativity 
and the ability to think outsite the box, changing perspectives and seeing trends.

I got my first computer when I was 14 and I learned programming, although I was not naturally talented. Being good in math and phsysics the idea was born to study engineering, although there were 
were other hidden passions like e.g. playing theatre.

I studied electrical engineering, but I noticed soon that it was actually a wrong decision. When others were talking about the details what we had learned I was thinking of ideas/businesses 
with you could start with it.
Just before the end of the studies the internet became popular. When I first opened the browser and surfed 
in the world wide I immediatly realised that the internet will change the world and I want to be part of it. I published my first shopping website a few weeks later and decided to start a freelancer career as a software developer in this field after graduating.

I graduated with a master degree in electrical engineering in 1997. A few months later I was looking for freelancing projects, which was a little naive at that time. But today I still make my living as freelancing developer which I am actually proud of.

I got my so called nanodegree in data analysis from [Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002?gclid=EAIaIQobChMItr_YwqHQ2gIVKb7tCh0GxA9rEAAYASAAEgJcH_D_BwE)] in 2017. Currently I am preparing for the [machine learning nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIoY-J-aHQ2gIVxjobCh19YAkqEAAYASAAEgKvf_D_BwE).
During the courses I discovered my passion for data and statistics which was sleeping around the surface for many years, but I must have had it already as a kid, when I was doing football statistics.

Today I am fascinated about entrepreneurship, sofware development, data science, [improvisational theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_theatre) and sports. 

I live with my partner and our 2 kids in Karlstein a. Main, which is between Aschaffenburg and Hanau in the Rhine-Main-Area.
