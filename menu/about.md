title: About me
---


Born in 1970 I am child of the seventies. That time was different than today:
Kids were rather playing outsite than insite, there were no smartphones, tablets or playstations and the TV program started not before 5pm (at least in Germany).

My daily routine at that time besides school was daydreaming, reading and doing my own little statistics about football.

The daydreaming was about starting businesses, being a famous football player, poltician, rock star, detective... Today I'd say that the daydreaming pushed my creativity 
and the ability to think outsite the box, changing perspectives and seeing trends.

When I was 14 I got my first computer and I learned programming, although I was not a natural talent. Being good in math the idea was born to study engineering, although there were 
were other hidden talents like playing theatre.

I studied electrical engineering, but I noticed soon that it was actually a wrong decision. Just before the end of the studies the internet became popular. When I first opened the browser and surfed 
in the world wide I a immediatly realised that the internet will change the world and I want to be part of it. I published my first shopping website a few weeks later and decided to start a freelancer career after graduating.

I graduated with a master degree in electrical engineering in 1997.
