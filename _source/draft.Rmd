In my last article [Example Use Cases of Docker in the Data Science Process](https://jenslaufer.com/data/science/use-cases-of-docker-in-the-data-science-process.html)  I was talking about Docker in Data Science in genaral. This time I want to get my hands dirty with a more practical example. The [source code for this project available on Github](https://github.com/jenslaufer/neural-network-training-with-docker)

In this case study I want to show you how to train a shallow neural network on top of a InterceptionV3 model on CIFAR-10 within a Docker container. I used a standard technology stack for this project with Tensorflow, Keras with Python. Before going into the details I want to define some requirements for this little project:

- Training should be done in the cloud on AWS (or Azure, GCloud, Alibaba Cloud) on a GPU empowered instance
- NVIDIA docker should used to enable the training is done GPU power
- The whole data pipeline is covered within the container
- The different models are persisted with all models meta data on MongoDB
- Usage of Docker compose, as we have a multi container application (training container + MongoDB)
- The whole training setup is "logged" to keep everything reproducable

Input: 

The docker container is parameterized with initial a json file with the parameters for the training session the mongodb with all parameters for each training session. 

- session name 
- optimizer
- learning rate
- learning rate decay
- batch size
- number of epochs

Output:

- hdf5 model file
- model accuracy on test set
- trainings parameter for training session (input paramters)




### Training Scripts


I put the whole training pipeline into one script src/training.py. The file consist of one class for the whole training pipeline:

- Data retrieval: Images are downloaded from S3 and stored to folders needed for Keras.Images are splittedt inot traing and test set.
- Data preporcessiong: Images are preprocessed for extracting bottleneck features. Image augmentation is done, 
- Extracting bottleneck features. Features are persisted to mongodb
- Shallow neural network is intilaized
- Shallow neural network is trained on bottleneck features
- Model is persisted to MongoDB, along with log from training process, and training parameters



### Containerization







We use the official tensorflow image with python3 and gpu.

Then we install several linux dependencies which are needed. With the COPY statement we copy everything from the src and entrypoints into the container. We set the WORKDIR. This is directory the container is in when it's started. We add our src directory to the python path. 

The last line we define the entrypoint. This is the script to start our training.

We can build our container



#### Dockerfile

You put everything you need for training for the neural network into the Dockerfile, which defines the runtime environment for our training.



```{.Docker .numberLines} 
FROM tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu-py3
 
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
      bzip2 \
      g++ \
      git \
      graphviz \
      libgl1-mesa-glx \
      libhdf5-dev \
      openmpi-bin \
      wget && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY src /src

WORKDIR /src

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

ENV PYTHONPATH='/src/:$PYTHONPATH'

ENTRYPOINT ["entrypoints/entrypoint.train.gpu.sh"]

```

```shell
docker build -t jenslaufer/neural-network-training-with-docker .
docker-compose up -d  --force-recreate
```


Line 1: Definition of base image. The setup and configuration is inherited from this image. An official tensorflow image with python3 and gpu support is used.

Line 3-12: Installation of additional linux packages with a standard apt-get.

Line 14: Everthing from the local directeory src, which holds all trainings scripts and entrypoints, is copied into the image.

Line 16: Initial directory, when the conatiner is started

Line 18: Installation of python requirements

Line 19: src directory is added to PYTHONPATH 

Line 21: Definition of entrypoint for the image. This script is executed when the container is started. This scripts starts our python training script.


Our entrypoint shell script looks like this and is pretty self-explaining.


```bash
#!/bin/bash

python -m cnn.cifar10
```


First, you need to build the docker image.

```bash
docker build -t jenslaufer/neural-network-training-with-docker .
```

Theoretically you could start this container for the training. However it won't work as our training script needs a mongodb as persistence container for the trainings parameters and results.

You have in this case a multicontainer application. docker-compose is your fiend in this scenario. You create a docker-compose.yml in which the different containers are setup.

```{.yaml .numberLines} 
version: '2'

services:
  training:
    image: jenslaufer/neural-network-training-with-docker:latest
    container_name: neural-network-training-with-docker
    depends_on:
      - trainingdb

  trainingdb:
    image: mongo:3.6.12
    container_name: trainingdb
    ports:
      - 27018:27017
    command: mongod
```
