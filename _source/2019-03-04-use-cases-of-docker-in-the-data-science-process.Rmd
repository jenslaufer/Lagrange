This excellent [comic by Jeff Lofvers](http://donthitsave.com/comic/2016/07/15/it-works-on-my-computer) 
illustrates what you often face in software development but also in data science. You are preparing a data analysis or predictive model, 
but when you want to share it, it does not work on someone else machine. It fails, 
because libraries are missing, libraries have the wrong version ("dependency hell"), or configurations differ. Time-Consuming troubleshooting starts.

The solution is not far away: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) solves the problem of reproducibility in a lightweight manner, but also offers you many other advantages. 

__What is Docker?__

Docker is a free software that performs operating-system-level virtualisation.
Docker is used to running software packages called containers. Containers are isolated from each other and bundle their application, tools, libraries and configuration files. All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and are thus more lightweight than virtual machines. [[Wikipedia on Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software))]

Docker makes it easy to create, run and distribute applications. Applications are packaged up with everything that is needed to run the application. The concept guarantees that the container can be run on every docker runtime environment.

__Advantages of Docker__:

1. _Reproducibility_

    With Docker, you ensure that your software artefact (application, data analysis, model) runs on all docker runtime environment. Your shipments are more robust, as the container contains everything that's needed to run your artefact. You are not distributing only the code, but also the environment.

2. _Consisitency_

    Using docker containers lets you have one uniform and consistent runtime environment for all kinds of software artefacts: Data Analyses, Machine Learning Models, Dashboard Applications, Web Applications, Static Websites, Machine Learning Model Trainings. It reduces the time for system administration and lets you focus on your core work. You might know Anaconda environments; Docker is something similar for the __whole software ecosystem__.

3. _Tracability:_ 

    a.) Version controlling of Docker container code

    A Docker container is built from a script which is a human-readable summary of the necessary software dependencies and environment. This script can be version controlled. The script is entirely traceable this way.


    b.) Uniform distribution environment for all artefacts

    Docker containers can be stored in a repository within your organisation. You keep the whole version history this way.

4. _Portability_

    Docker containers can easily be ported from one docker environment to another, with tools like docker-machine.  [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) provide you with scalable cloud runtime environments.


However, what are the use-cases for Docker in the data science universe? I will concentrate on the data science [OSEMN process](https://www.thelead.io/data-science/5-steps-to-a-data-science-project-lifecycle):

## The use cases of Docker in the Data Science Process

Reality is today that the process has a big variety of tools and programming languages. Docker is the goto platform to manage these hetergogenous technology stacks, as each container just provides the runtime environment it needs to run exactly the one application it is packed around. The interference of technology stacks is reduced this way.

### 1. Obtain: Gather Data from relevant sources

Data is the oil for data science. You need to retrieve it from surveys, clinical trials, web scraping, scientific experiments, corporate applications or simulations. The technology stack is very hetergogenous in this field, as different stakeholders run applications that generate data. Docker is ideal for such hetergogenous environments

  - Application for scraping data from the web
  - Application to label images 
  - Microsite for surveys 
  - Corporate web application that generates data while customers use it
  - Computer simulation that 
  - Asynchronous data streams that distributes data from low level devices

### 2. Scrub: Clean and aggregate data to formats the machine understands

The Data which was obtained in Step 1 is the oil, but right now it's raw oil. You need to clean, process and combine it to the data you need for analysis and modelling. This involves a technology stack with a variety of database systems and programming languages.

  - Applications which aggregate new data from raw data and persist it to new databases
  - Applications which combine data from different data sources
  - Apllications which clean the data 
  

### 3. Explore: Find patterns and trends

In the exploration phase, all you have to do is understand what patterns and values are in the hands of the data. You want to make the results available to everyone interested.

  - Interactive Data Exploring Dashboard Applications Shiny, Dash, Kibana, Tableau etc.
  

### 4. Model: Construct models to predict and forecast

Now, we have come to an exciting step. The so-called model is the general model in statistics. You can think of a machine learning model as a tool lying in your toolbox. You have many algorithms to choose from, and you can use them to help achieve different business goals. The better the features you want, the better your predictive ability will be. After cleaning up the data and extracting essential features, we can use the model as a predictive tool to improve the effectiveness of business decisions.

Predictive Analytics has become the key to changing the rules of the game. What predictive analysis does is not to look back at the “what happened”, but to help managers answer questions such as “What will be next?” and “How should we respond?” (from Forbes Magazine).

- Microservices which provide a machine learning model

- Static website to provide data story articles
- Microsites  to tell the data story
- Tableau server to tell data stories
- Microservices, which offer models 


## Conclusion

Docker is a powerful tool also for data scientists and can be applied to all stages in the OSEMN process. You can provide all kind of applications in a consistent, reproducible and traceable way. The applications can be very different in their technology stack, which is the reality in data science projects. Data engineers work with databases like Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB, Reddis or ElasticSearch or programming languages like Java, Python or C++. In the analytics and modelling team, people might work with R, Python, Julia or Scala, while data storytellers tell their story with d3.js in JavaScript or use Tableau. As specialists are rare, it's better to let the people work with the stuff they know instead of them into specific technology stacks they are not familiar with. You get better results faster. Docker is the way to go to manage this heterogeneous application landscape.
