![But it works on my machine](http://i.imgur.com/PnvK7v6.png)
This excellent [comic by Jeff Lofvers](http://donthitsave.com/comic/2016/07/15/it-works-on-my-computer) 
illustrates what you often face also in data science. You are preparing a data analysis or predictive model, 
but when you want to share share you share it, it does not work on someone else machine. It fails, 
because libraries are missing, libaries are having the wrong version or the other machines are configured in a different manner.

But there is gerate way to solve this problem: Docker. It solves the problem of reproducability in lightweight manner, but also offers you many other advantages.
