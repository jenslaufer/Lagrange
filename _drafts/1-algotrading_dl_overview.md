# The reinforcement learning for trading adventure: 1-Overwiew

Lately my colleague and me landed a big deal from a chinese company: The goal of the project is to implement a trading algorithm. I want to write a article series to share our experiences along the project. First I want to tell you why the project is a big adventure for us. It has different components which makes it so interesting, but also challenging.

## The client is from China

Working for a client from overseas is an adventure by itself, but we guess that a client from China is a challenge, because of the cultural differences. The client seems very pragmatic in comparison to european clients. Fixing the contract was done within a few days. A few days after signing the contract we got the data for 65 instruments. It was not uploaded to the cloud what you would expect in these days, instead we received a 1TB harddrive (no joke!) filled with 560GB trading data. We guess the data is worth a lot. However, we cannot trade on the Chinese Market as non-chinese. Maybe a reason why the client outsourced the project to non-chinese.

## Reinforcement Learning for our trading agent

Classical algorithmic trading is a method of executing orders using automated pre-programmed trading instructions 
  
## It's our first full lifecycle data science project, from analysis and preprocessing of the raw data to bringing the models into production

## The client provides us our own deep learning platform for teaching our models
