R and Python are outstanding languages for data science. While Python is a easy-to-learn general-purpose language R 
is a niche language from the statistics fields. Python's pandas and numpy library  and base R are very similiar for 
data processing. One could say, that there is no need to learn R, however thanks to Hadley Wickham's tidyverse 
libraries with their grammar of graphics (ggplot2) and grammar of data manipulation (dpylr) 
R is superior for data analysis and processing. It's therefore worth to have both languages in your toolset. 

Is it possible to use the language site-by-site? Let's think of a scenario where we use R for 
data preprocessing and Python for training machine learning models. In this article I want to show you 
how to use R functions in our Python code. We want to use [rpy2](https://rpy2.readthedocs.io), which lets us 
call functions in R library like functions in Python code. However there are several pitfalls I want to show you. 
We use Docker in this example to get reprocable environment.

## Step 1: Setup of the library boilerplate code in r

## Step 2: S
