R and Python are outstanding languages for data science. While Python is a easy-to-learn general-purpose language is R a niche language for statistics. Python's pandas and numpy library  and base R are very similiar for data processing. One could say, that there is no need to learn R, however thanks to Hadley Wickham's tidyverse libraries with their grammar of graphics (ggplot2) and grammar of data manipulation (dpylr) R is superior for data analysis and processing. It's therefore worth to have both languages in your toolset.

Is it possible to use the language site-by-site? Let's think of a scenario where we use R for
data preprocessing and Python for training machine learning models. In this article I want to show you
how to use R functions in our Python code. We want to use [rpy2](https://rpy2.readthedocs.io), which lets us call functions in R library like functions in Python code. However there are several pitfalls I want to show you. We use Docker in this example to get a reproducable environment.

## Step 1- Setup our R library and implement our function 

We change into a R console and execute the following commands:

```R
install.packages('devtools')
library('devtools')
devtools::create('reducer')
```

These commands create a basic file structure for our module. The R directory will hold all R files for our library.

```shell
.
├── DESCRIPTION
├── NAMESPACE
└── R
```

> The NAMESPACE file specifies the interface to the package that is presented to the user. This is done via a series of export() statements, which indicate which functions in the package are exported to the user. Functions that are not exported cannot be called directly by the user (although see below). In addition to exports, the NAMESPACE file also specifies what functions or packages are imported by the package. If your package depends on functions from another package, you must import them via the NAMESPACE file. [[1]](https://rstats-pkgs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/namespace.html)

```R
exportPattern("^[^\\.]")
importFrom("magrittr","%>%")
```

> The DESCRIPTION file is an essential part of an R package because it contains key metadata for the package that is used by repositories like CRAN and by R itself. In particular, this file contains the package name, the version number, the author and maintainer contact information, the license information, as well as any dependencies on other packages.  [[2]](https://rstats-pkgs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/description.html)

```yaml
Package: reducer
Title: Reduces time series
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "First",
           family = "Last",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "first.last@example.com",
           comment = c(ORCID = "YOUR-ORCID-ID"))
Description: Reduces time series
License: What license it uses
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
Imports:  
    tidyverse
```

We switch into the R folder and create a R script called api.R with our implementation.
We have helper function, that starts with a dot to ensure, that the function is not exported.
Our main function called 'reduce' accepts a data frame with timeseries, that we can reduce the data frame
to a certain time.interval and time.unit. The time interval for our data frame is e.g. 1 second, we can then reduce to 10 seconds. For the data the mean function is applied. It's important that we use in our code the full library path (@TODO check how it is called) and don't used any library and require statements. The importatnt libaries are handeld durcing library installed and referenced in the Imports section in the DESCRIPTION file.

```R

.get.super.unit <- function(unit) {
  switch(
    unit,
    "second" = "minute",
    "minute" = "hour",
    "hour" = "day",
    "day" = "month",
    "month" = "year"
  )
}

reduce <- function(df, time.interval, time.unit, date_field) {
  super.unit <- .get.super.unit(time.unit)
  unit.pl <- "lubridate::{time.unit}s" %>% glue::glue()
  unit <- "lubridate::{time.unit}" %>% glue::glue()
  
  df %>%
    dplyr::mutate(
      interval = lubridate::floor_date(!!as.name(date_field), unit = super.unit) + eval(parse(text = unit.pl))(ceiling(
        eval(parse(text = time.unit))(!!as.name(date_field)) / time.interval
      ) * time.interval)
    ) %>%
    dplyr::group_by(interval) %>%
    dplyr::summarise_all(~ mean(.)) %>%
    dplyr::ungroup() %>%
    dplyr::select(-date) %>%
    dplyr::rename(date = interval)
}

```


## Step 2- Use GitHub for version controlling and as R library repository


We create a new Git repository for our project on the Github website:

![Project Creation on Github](https://res.cloudinary.com/jenslaufer/image/upload/c_scale,w_888/v1569306497/github_repo_create.png)

```shell
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial"
git remote add origin git@github.com:jenslaufer/sample-r-library-reducer.git
git push -u origin master
```

Once we pushed our code to Github, we can install our library with the install.github function with the devtools library in R. 
We use a public repository  in our case which makes live easy, however you can install as well install libraries from private repositories.
In case you have R already installed you can install and use our library now. Don't mind if you don't have R. We will use Docker in 
this example, so there is no need to install it.

```R
install.github('jenslaufer/sample-r-library-reducer')
library(reducer)

@TODO code for creating a data frame
data
reducer::reduce(data, 5, "minute", date)
```

This should print "reducing." to the screen.

## Step 3- Write Python code to call function R library

We create the code to call the first simple implementation of our r rlibrary and put into a file named test.py:

```python
import pandas as d
import rpy2.robjects.packages as rpackages
from rpy2.robjects import r, pandas2ri

pandas2ri.activate()

df = p

reducer = rpackages.importr('reducer')

reducer.reduce()
```

You can see, that it is pretty simple to import our R library. The trickest part is to ensure that our 
Pandas data frame is automatically transformed into an R data frame. We do this by using pandas2ri.activate() in rpy2 in the beginning.

## Step 4- Get everything up and running Docker

To have a reliable reproducable runtime environment it's a good idea to run your application unto [Docker](https://docker.com). 
You can download it from the website for the most important  operating systems.

Docker is software is software tool to create lightweight containers with everything needed to run an application. 
You increase the reproducability and protability of you application by doing this. Our requirement is a container with two programming languages and some
preinstalled libraries. Get this setup working reliable in a production environment without Docker could be difficult.

In our case we need a container with R, Python, our preinstalled libary and rpy2. This setup s

- Docker container with R and Python installed

```Dockerfile
FROM jenslaufer/python-r:py37

RUN R -e "install.github('jenslaufer/sample-r-library-reducer')"
```

We use a base container with pre installed Python 3.7. On top we are installing base R, afterwards are are installing serveral important libarires in the contain
Our libray is installed with the install.github the command we talked about before. Last not but least we are installing the rpy2 module with pip for python.

We can build the container, however I have done this for you. So we can use the conatiner just now

```shell
docker exec -it jenslaufer/reducer:latest bash
```

What does this line do? It downloads our already-built computer to your machine and opens a bash in the container. So we can easily execute our Python example code now, 
everything what we need for excution is packed in the container.
