# A lost day in life

This day was bad, really bad. Time is precious and get I cannot get the time back for this day, which frustrates me. I should just forget about the day.
On the other had there are still another 7.5 hours today. Isn't quiet a long time to try to make the best out of the day. Or is it better to calm down, relax?

I can still spend the time with my kids and my wife. Have a nice meal. Read an inspiring article. Write something. I should concentrate on the now, and not think about the past 
nor the future. I will lose even more time with the new project. However, I can learn stuff I wanted to learn in any case. So I can learn it and even earn some money with it.
However, it's much more relaxing to learn something with my own approach.
