# Three years of good habits

It all started on January 1st, 2017. I read once the book the power of habits, so I knew what habits are about and how they work.
I had gained a weight before that date, so I felt unhealthy. I resigned from a contracting job at the end of 2016 and I wanted to make
2017 my year by pushing my dream of my own business through. However, I my goal was to improve life in general, by healthier eating and doing
more sports. So I started the year with the resolution of doing every day sports for 15 minutes, eating a variation of five kinds of fresh fruits and five kinds of fresh vegetables. I cutted also my sugar consumption. Another habits on my habits list was my goal was to work more work focused.
Within a few months I lost 6 kilos weight and I felt actually better. However the I couldn't build up my own business, as I lost my focus and
stopped too early.

Three years later I still haven't reached the goal yet. It feels very frustrating, because having my own business is THE GOAL for me and the beginning of next year is very special for me as I turn 50 by next year. However, everything is not that bad as it seems. The last three years are a big success, as I am still eating all these fruits and vegetables and I missed out 30 times doing sports, which is nothing in compare to the 1095 days of these three years. Today I work just much more focused and cut my work to only 5 hours of concentrated work per day. I realized the importance of writing, since a year I wrote almost every day. I started meditation a few weeks. This is my new power habit for the next year. All these habits help me to live a better life.
