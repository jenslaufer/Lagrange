# The IT Crisis

It's the 11th of November 2021 and it happened for the first time in history. The german bank Deutsche Bank claimed bankruptcy, because it wasn't able to handle it's own IT anymore. It was simply too complicated and nobody knew how the systems are interlinked with each other nor how some of the system were actually working. It started one and a half weeks before when some batch jobs weren't able to transfer money from and to the banks customers accounts. Many customers got into trouble, because the customers couldn't pay invoices, loans. Business weren't able to pay salaries. The bank was not able to get the batch job running again. By the end of the week most customers weren't able to get hold of their money lying on Deutsche Banks accounts. Many companies that had their money at the bank went bankrupt themselves, because weren't able to get touch of their money. In the end, the German banking supervisory authority stopped all of the bank's business activities.

Two years ago many external self-employed IT consultants were kicked out of the bank, because of the tightening of the law on bogus self-employment. The internal IT staff wasn't able to understand their own systems. The bank that they could bring all external IT staff into the bank.
