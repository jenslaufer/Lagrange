I am a software engineer and data scientist. I love programming, but I hate to write code. For me programming is about solving a problem with the bare minimum lines of code. It saves me time and every line less reduces the risk of having a bug. I dislike to reinvent the wheel, I rather like to use as many librariers as possible to keep things simple. I love the principle of [convention over configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration), which helps me to descrease the number of decisions. 

For me Docker is a essential part in my toolchain, as I can ship my work with the runtime environment it needs for its execution in a lightweight manner. I wrote lately article with a [Practical example of Training a Neural Network in the AWS cloud with Docker](https://jenslaufer.com/data/science/practical-example-of-deep-learning-in-docker.html). I invested a lot of time into the article and the coding to show an example how great Docker is also in Data Science. I thought the article is my master piece, however instead the article was a big fail. Besides being too long and complicated, there was another problem:

__Data Scientists simple don't care about Docker__ 

But why is this? 

As a data scientist you want to concentrate on solving problems in a simple and straighforward way, like me in programming.  It's the reason why most data scientists love Jupyter. You can quickly craft data analyses and models along with notes. However we over-use notebooks, which has its price. Notebooks fail terribly when it comes to deliver work. For sure it's easy to share the link to the notebook, but version control a notebook is a nightmare, a model which was trained in a notebook is difficult to bring into production. You cannot unit-test your code, which increases the time you spend on debugging.

In this article I have tipps how you can change your coding style in a way that you can still use Jupyter Notebooks for what they are good for and deliver you work in a lightweight manner. You learn how to ship your work in Docker container without knowing to much about Docker.

## 1. Write functions and unit test them

Use a function whenever possible and write a unit test for it. Keep the functions small and simple. I know people hate unit tests, but once you get used to them they feel right. They decrease the time you spend on stupid debugging and you have more time for you like to do.


## 2. Pack your code into modules

Pack you code into a module and put it unter version control. You can easisly track your code this way, you can do branch it, you can do diffs  on code changes. In the module you define what libraries are needed to use it. All dependent librariers are installed when you module is used.
To setup a module you just need a __init_.py (from python > 3.4 you can skip it) and a setup.py. Creating a module is not a big deal.

## 2. Keep the most code out Your Notebooks

Try to keep your code out of the notebook. The noteboods looks more clear this way.



## 3. Build a docker container, when you need to it

There are situation when building docker containers has many advantages:

- You train
