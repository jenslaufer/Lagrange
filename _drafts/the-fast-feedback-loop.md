# The two elements from software development we can copy to keep us motivated

In software development there is paradigm called __Test Driven Development__. Basically a developer writes a test for every piece of code, to ensure that his code does what it is supposed to do. It turns out that in a long run a software developers spends less time in finding errors in the code. Two elements of Test Driven Development are interesting for non-programmers as they increase the inner motivation and can keep everybody of us in a flow state:  

### 1. Chunking



### 2. The fast-feedback-loop

<!-- TODO example with green and red bars in Eclipse-->

## Conclusion

The fast-feedback-loop and chunking give our inner motivation a boost. We split our project into smaller easier to handle smaller chunks. Then we build in a kind of a fast-feedback-loop.
