# A embarassing moment in live and what I learned from it

It was in 1995. I had a bit of a crisis when I was writing a thesis during studying electrical engineering, so I headed to the travel agency for a short holiday to see something else than the university.  A few days later I was sitting in the plane to Santorini in the greek sea with my backpack and tent. I was hopping from one island to the next, was walking a lot during the day and thought about my thesis and live in general. This was very inspiring and mind freeing.

It happened on the island of Paros one night. I was on a campsite with my tent and had to go the toilet. I left my torch in the tent. I wanted get back to my tent, however it was so pitch dark, that I couldn't find it. Living for a while in a bigger city, I really forgot how dark it is on the country site at night. You know how it is, in the beginning you are relaxed, but then you get more in a panic mode.  I had sveral attempts to find tent, I was worried stumbling over others tents cords or waking up the people while sneaking around theirs tents over and over. I ended up seeking 3 hours for my tent. I felt completely embarrassed and I was very sad. I remember that I felt like the dumbest person in live and I was even crying in the tent.

Today I laugh about the story. I told it many people and we all ended lauging about it. I learned one lesson from it:

## It's stories we can tell what makes live interesting

I still remember this story although it happened a long time ago. 1995? I can't remember anything from that year. Only this unique story and the tough thesis.
It's stories that make live interesting and we can tell our kids and friends. It's stories that sticks. So next time when having misfortune next time. Think about it as story you maybe tell the rest of your live.
