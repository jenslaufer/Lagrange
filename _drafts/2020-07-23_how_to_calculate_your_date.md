Your period is late, and you hope that you might be pregnant. Full of curiosity you want to calculate what your due date is.
However, that's more difficult than you thought. We know all that you are pregnant for 9 months. So you simply add up 9 months to the date of conception. You are sure what the time of conception is: It was February 12, 2020. By adding up 9 months, the estimated date of delivery (EDD) or due date would be November 12, 2020.

You are not so sure about it, because your friend once told you the date is calculated with the time of the last period, which would make sense, as not every woman knows the exact day of conception.

You call your friend Lisa who tells you that it's easy to calculate the due date: You are actually for 40 weeks pregnant after the first day of the last period. So you take your calendar and add 40 weeks to the first day of your last period, which was January 28, 2020. You end up with November 02, 2020. You mark the date in the calendar with a heart because you are so happy.

You tell your friend Sarah the excellent news, who is a mom of beautiful twins. Sarah's says that gynaecologists calculate the due date differently: They use Naegele's rule that is named after the German obstetrician Franz Naegele who devised the rule.

The formula to calculate your Estimated Due Date using Naegele's rule:

_Date of Estimated Date of Delivery = Date of Last Menstrual Period + 7 Days + 12 months - 3 months_

You recalculate the Estimated Date of Delivery again and end up this time: November 04, 2020.

On the same day, you still get doubts because your cycle length is not 28 days but 30 days and you don't know if this has any influence. So on the same day, you call Sarah again to ask her advice. She tells you that you must add two days. The modified formula is then:

_Date of Estimated Date of Delivery = Date of Last Menstrual Period + 7 Days + 12 months - 3 months + Your Cycle Lenght - 28 days_

Your Estimated Date of Delivery is November 06, 2020.
That's what the doctor tells you a few days later. Good that you knew already how to calculate the date.

We created [Estimated Date of Delivery (EDD) Calculator](https://apps.givebirthto.me/duedatecalculator/) based on the modified Naegele's rule. It simplifies the calculation.
