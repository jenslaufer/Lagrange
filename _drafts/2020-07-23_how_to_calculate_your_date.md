Your period is late and you hope that you might be pregnant. Full of curiosity you want to calculate what your due date is.
However, that's more difficult than what you thought. We know all that you are pregnant for 9 month. So you simply add up 9 month to the date of conception. You are quiet sure what the date of conception is: It was February 20, 2020. By adding up 9 month the estimated date of delivery (EDD) or due date would be: November 20, 2020.

You are not so sure about it, because your friend once told you the date is calculated with the date of the last period, which would make sense, as not ever woman knows the exact day of conception.

You call your friend Lisa who tells you that it's easy to calculate the due: You are actually for 40 weeks pregnant for 40 weeks after the first day of the last period. So you take your calendar and add 40 weeks to first day of your last period which was the January 28, 2020. You end up with November 02, 2020. You mark it in the calendar.

You tell the good new your friend Sarah, who is a mom of wonderful twins. Sarah's tells you that gynecologists calculate the due date differently: They use Naegele's rule that is named after the German obstetrician Franz Naegele who devised the rule.

Theformula to calculate your Estimated Due Date using Naegele's rule:

_Date of Estimated Date of Delivery = Date of Last Menstrual Period + 7 Days + 12 months - 3 months_

You recalculate the Eistimated Date of Delivery again and end up this time: November 04, 2020.

You are happy as the date is just 2 days later than with 40 weeks calculation method.
