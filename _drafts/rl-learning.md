# Why I want to Reinforcement Learning

I got my first insights into Reinforcement Learning in my course for the [Machine Learning Nanodegree](). I teached a car learning to drive. The car got the sensor data for the directions to the final destination and the data for color of the traffic lights. The car could drive stop, go straight, turn left or right. The whole example was implemented from the scratch, to learn idea for reinforcement learning. But it was actually too much code to understand the basic ideas about the environment, the agent. I understood the concept a bit, but not everything. I tried later to find more example. All these examples were using the openai framework. The problem was, that the examples had nothing in common with the implementation in the course. On the other hand I am a software engineer, who wnats to use frameworks to solve different problems with the same patterns.

These days I gave RL another try, as I want to create a automatic self learning stock trading bot. Trading seems a good field for reinforcement learnings, as you get a human being also creates a strategy when trading to try to maximize the earnings. The data is available everywhere. The field seems easier than let an agent learn to play chess, but more profitable.

So let's quickly brainstorm what questions and problems I have. The goal is to solve the problems. I am a hands on type of person. The goal is to have a working strategy at the end.

- What algorithms are suitable for the problem?
- Can I develop a minimal working example?
