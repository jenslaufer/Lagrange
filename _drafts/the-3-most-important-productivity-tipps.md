# My productivity tipps


Over the last months I gained a lot of productivity. I want to share my lessons learned with you.

## Working in blocks

This is the math of my working. I am doing 6 blocks with 50 minutes a day. That's 5 hours of concentrated focused work. Between the blocks I am having a 15 minutes break. After 3 blocks theier isa longer 60 minutes break. I start work at 08:30 am and I am finished by 3:30 pm.

During the break I am staying away from my notebook. My first break I am preparing the coffee machine for the lunch break, in the second break I am preparing a fresh salad for my lunch break. In the longer 3rd break I am eating my salad and having my coffee. Then I am heading for a 25 minutes nap. In the 4th and 5th break I am doing a short walk.

I bought myself noice canceling headphones which I am having on in the working block listening music the increases focus.

This routine increased my productivity a lot.

## Start the morning with a healthy, fresh breakfast and a workout

My day starts with a healthy breakfast with at least 5 kinds of fresh fruit, cereals with nuts and chia seeds.

After my wife and the kids left the house I am having a 25 minutes workout with a cold shower the end. I feel fresh and energized and I am ready and keen to work.

## Must-have woring habits

I am having two must-have-workimg habits. 

1. In the morning I write tow blocks and publish work in the third block to promote my work

2. In the afternoon I create products w.g with programming
