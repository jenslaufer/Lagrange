# Is it possible to rate aesthetics of images with a computer program?

Yes, it's possible, however not with classical programming. What do I
mean with classical programming? __Classical programming is rule-based__: It defines
rules that are processed (think of if...else statements). What could be the rules for beautiful images? You might think of high resolution image 
with a beach and a blue sky. However, sometimes the photo might be a blurry one with an interesting person on it. Or a colorful
