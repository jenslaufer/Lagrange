# What kind of software product can be made out of machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow?

In classical programming, you build models by implementing rules with your human intuition. In contrast to rules-based programming machine learning is based on algorithms that can learn from data without somebody defining explicit rules. It's a fascinating approach because the algorithms can catch up patterns a human might not capture. **Machine Learning is a way to learn the ineffable**.

Cassie Kozyrkov wrote a very intuitive article on it:

With this in mind, there is an endless list of machine learning software products. However, you have to keep in mind that you need data to train machine learning models. In supervised learning you need labelled data. Collecting data and labelling them takes a lot of effort.
I brainstormed some examples of machine learning software products:

* Detect traffic signs for self-driving cars
* Face detection 
* Number plate detection in photos
* Detect breast cancer in MRI scans
* Detect skin cancer from pictures
* Trading Agent
* Predict if a stock price is more likely to go up or down
* Predict the energy consumption of households
* Detect spam emails
* Detect fraud in financial transactions

I trained a model to quantify the aesthetics of images, which is an excellent example of learning the ineffable:
