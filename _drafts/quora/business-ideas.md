# What are the best ways to think of ideas for a startup?

Dan Lewis answer is excellent. However, I'd like to change the perspective a bit.
Instead of finding business ideas, which is a kind of a creative process, you can also search for business opportunities. 

The internet is full of websites, which offer their customers metrics to help them with their product decisions. The metrics are, e.g. the number of product purchases,  product rankings, number of reviews, but also textual product reviews. On other sites, people tell about their problems and pain points or ask questions.  Google, Facebook or LinkedIn offer tools to sell Ads. With these tools, you can find out what people are searching for. You find many business opportunities on these sites.


To illustrate how it works you can check an article that I published last year: [Case Study: How to find a Business Opportunity in Sports Psychology](https://jenslaufer.com/entrepreneurship/how-to-find-a-business-opportunity.html)
