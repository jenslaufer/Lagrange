# Is R overrated?

R isn't overrated due its powerful toolbox for data analysis. The tidyverse ecosystem within R e.g. provides a grammar of data manipulation with dplyr and a grammar of data visualization with ggplot2. These libraries are superior to similar libraries in Python, as the customized grammar approach lets you focus on data analysis instead of learning a complex syntax.

However R should never be the only tool in your tool belt in data science. It's worth your while to learn Python as well. Python is a easy-to-learn general purpose programming language. All major machine and deep learning libraries have Python implementations. You can do much more with Python than data science. Web development is a good example.

Equip your tool belt box with the right tools. Rather than putting your energy into flame wars you should explore languages by simply learning them. Adapting languages is getting easier once you know one language.
