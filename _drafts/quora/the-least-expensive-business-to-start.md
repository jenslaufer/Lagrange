# What is the least expensive but most profitable business an entrepreneur could start?

The least expensive option for a profitable business is to __sell somebody else products__.

You can __set up a niche website__ for free, __publish top-quality and valuable content__ for your niche audience,  __promote this content__ in the channels where your niche audience is, __connect to the audience__ e.g. by collecting email addresses. Then you __sell somebody else products__ for a commission.
You can include product links into your content.

With this approach, you are still flexible to create your products one day, place someone else Ads, as you are connected with your niche audience.
