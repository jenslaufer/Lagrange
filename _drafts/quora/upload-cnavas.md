# How can I store and review all my ideas of new business ideas?

An interesting approach for developing new or documenting existing business models on a single page is the Business Model Canvas - Wikipedia, which was developed by Alexander Osterwalder.

You can download a PDF template for it:

Ash Maurya modified it for Lean Startups: 1-Page Business Plan | LEANSTACK

You can get a free PDF for it too:

You can fill out these PDF templates and upload them e.g. to Google Docs.

There are as well different options to maintain (upload and download) your canvas online. You can easily find them with a web search.
