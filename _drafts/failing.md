Story: My daughter is angry, screaming and in terrible mood after losing game. School is easy for her, however there is also situation when she is overwhelmed. As adults we discuss with the kids in meantime most still have the same attitude about failing. The problem it's painful, therefore we concentrate on the good feeling of success and forget about the pain. Have you ever seen these angry super competitive sports people losing the final at a world championship blaming everything about losing the big match and how they are the only one who deserved to win.
We have to keep in mind: Playing a game is about agreeing on a contract that there are winners losers. Why do we play that game? We do it to pass boredom. But it is an up and down. There is a risk of feeling worse than before when we were bored. But for sure we might feel better in case we win. However if we constantly win, we will feel bored again.

Therefore we have to learn to cope with failing. Failing is an adventure. We should concentrate on the process of failing instead of concentrate too  much on the end result the success. Concentrating on the process (the learning, the failing) is what makes show you up each day.
