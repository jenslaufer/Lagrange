# The Exploration and Exploitation trade-off in human behaviour

## How machine learning is inspired by how we learn a behaviour and what we can learn from this for our lives.

In machine learning, there is a learning approach, which is called reinforcement learning. It is inspired by how we humans learn behaviour. The central concept behind it is that we interact with our environment with actions, and we get a reward as a result of the action. The reward can be negative, resulting in bad consequences/feelings or positive, resulting in good outcomes/feelings or neutral. In the beginning, we don't know much about our environment, so we try to explore it, the more we know about the environment, the more we can harvest the positive rewards and avoid the negative ones. We also develop strategies to do actions that result in neutral or negative rewards but let us collect more significant long-term positive rewards (e.g. going to university). In machine learning, you have to deal with the exploration vs exploitation trade-off: In the beginning, you must choose a high exploration ratio to learn as much about your environment. But after a while, you have to exploit the positive rewards, as this is what you need to succeed in your environment. But even if you trained an algorithm for long a time, it is good to still explore the environment from time to time, as it might have changed and the algorithm might find new unknown paths with even bigger positive rewards, that he hasn't discovered yet.

The concept is powerful and let me think about our own behaviour. When we are kid, we try out a lot of stuff, and we often fail. We often react emotionally to these bad experiences with bad mood or tears. They feel like punishments with a negative reward. Then we got older and get more stable because we exploit more the paths with positive rewards. We form automatism in the form of habits. Some of these habits are bad, like the eating-chocolate-habit with the sugar reward, which lets us gain weight and diseases. In the twenties, we still explore a world around us, but it happens less than when we were a kid. When we start working, there is a significant shift towards that money is getting our main reward or lousy eating habits. We exploit these rewards intensively, and most of us stop to explore the world. At some point, we are getting bored in live, resulting in depression, mid-life crisis or we burned-out and over-worked by our intensive way to exploit money rewards. On the other hand, there is a minority of people who are down-and-out as they don't exploit the rewards and still do too much of exploration. These are the two sides of the coin of the exploitation-vs-exploration-trade-off in real life.

What can we learn from this? When we are getting getting older, we should still shift from time-to-time into the exploration mode to find new ways for rewards in life. So what can we do?

- Learn a new language
- Learn new skills even n areas we are not talented with, e.g. paintings, sports
- Form new hobbies
- Go on sabbatical to explore new paths
- Try out new food
- Travel to exotic countries
- Leave our comfort zone
- Meet new people
- Apply for a new job

The exploration will lead to failures, we will feel uncomfortable again and maybe cry again as the kids do it. But we learn from these failures and the up and downs is what makes life interesting. We might find new talents with more positive rewards.

So open new doors in life and switch to the exploration mode.
