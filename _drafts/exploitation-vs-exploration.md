# The Exploration and Exploitation trade off

## How machine learning is inspired by how we learn and what we can learn from this for our live.

In machine learning there is a learning approach, which is called reinforcement learning. It is inspired how we humans learn behavior. The main concept behind it is that we interact with our environment with actions and we get a reward as a result on the action. The reward can be negative, resulting in bad consequences or positive resulting a good consequences or neutral. In the beginning we don't know much about our environment, so we try to explore it, the more we know about the environment we harvest the positive rewards and avoid the negative ones. We develop also strategies to do actions that results in neutral or negative rewards but let us even collect bigger long-term positive rewards. In the machine learning you have to deal with the exploration vs exploitation trade-off: In the beginning you must choose a high exploration ratio to learn as much about your environment. But after a while you have to exploit the positive rewards, as this is what you want to learn. But even if you trained the algorithmn for long a time it is good to still explore the envrironment a bit, as it changes and you might find new unknown paths of positive rewards.

The concept is quiet powerful and let me think about our own behavior. When we are kid, we try out a lot of stuff and we often fail. We often react emotional on these bad experiences with bad mood or tears. Then we got older and get more stable, because we exploit what works in live. During the time stuff in the mid-twenties we do still explore a world around us, but it much less than as kid. When we start working there is a big shift towards that money is getting our main reward. We exploit these rewards intensively and most of us stop to explore the world. At some point we are getting bored in live, resulting depression, mid-life crisis or we burned-out and over-worked with our intensive  way to exploit the rewards (=money as an infant). On the other hand there is a minority of people who are down-and-out as they didn't exploit the rewards and still doing much of exploration.

What can we learn from this? When are getting getting older we should still shift from time-to-time into the exploration mode to find new ways to of rewards in live. So what can we do?

- Learn new skills
- To go on sabbatical
- Travel to exotic countries
- Leave our comfort zone
- Meet new people
- Apply for a new job


This exploartion will lead to failures, we will feel uncorfotable but we learn from these failures. However, the up and downs is what makes live interesting.
