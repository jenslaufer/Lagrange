Lately, I had to develop a predictive model for a client. We all know how it is; you are under pressure to get the things right fast. You craft some Jupyter notebooks to explore the data and to clean it. You build models, go back and forward, move from one to another Notebook and copy code, you move to Colab to quickly get additional computer power, build docker containers to ship models. Sooner or later you end up in a mess. I am not experienced with data science. However, I have 20 years of experience in software engineering. From the perspective of my inner software engineer that working style was unacceptable and embarassing. My only excuse was that I was faced to pressure. 

I gave me a day to review my code and clean it. There were some mistakes I made. Copy and pasting code is one of the worst practices you can think of. Another mistake was that I was misusing Jupyter Notebooks as an IDE. Instead they are a tool for taking notes and presentations with live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Yes, I might train models in notebooks, but I think it's bad practice.  Software Code in Notebooks is challenging to maintain and is not traceable as it does not integrate well into version control systems like Git. I didn't write any unit tests as it is hard in Jupyter notebooks.

I ended up reducing the code in the notebooks to a bare minimum. This action made the notebooks more transparent. Now I could take the advantages of version controlling of the code with Git, could use my favourite IDE again and increased the reusability of my code.

There was that one little secret that helped me out to let my code shine with a massive gain in flexibility:

__PACKAGES WITH MODULES__

We all know modules and packages, but the real power of packages comes with putting them into a Git repository and use Git as our source code repository and pip package repository.

## What is a Python module?

A module is a Python object with arbitrarily named attributes that you can bind and reference: A module is a file consisting of Python code.

I quickly demonstrate the usage of a module along with a Jupyter Notebook. Moving functionality to a module is simple: We put the code into functions and move this function to a new Python file. The advantage of this that we can reduce the code in the notebook. By choosing the function names wisely, we make the code fragments self-explaining without the need for additional comments. 

We can put a module in the same directory as the notebook or we can put into a subdirectory structure to keep multiple modules together in a package.

```code
│   greetings.py
│   MyNotebook.ipynb
│
├───myproject
│   │   useful.py
```

The code in the notebook are now just one or two-liners, and the function names make.

Jupyter has problems with reloading modules. Adding the following lines on top of our notebook save us much trouble.

```python
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
```


## How to create a Python package in Git and install it from there

The real power of modules comes by moving a package with several modules in its own Github repository and use it as our pip package repository. For this we refactor a bit our code. We create a modules directory with each module in it's own folder. We put each module in it's own Git repository. All notebooks we put in another Git repository. Now we can release versions or create branches of out code.

```code
├───modules
│   └───myproject              --
│       |                       │
│       │   setup.py            │
│       │                       │
│       └───myproject           │ One module in one Git repository
│           │   greetings.py    │ 
│           │   useful.py       │
│           │   __init__.py     │
│           │                  --
└───notebooks                  --
    │   MyNotebook-1.ipynb      │
    │   Modeling.ipynb          │ Notebooks in one Git repository
    |   EDA.ipynb               │
    |                          --
```

We create a setup.py to make the module installable with pip. The setup.py holds information about the module like the version and the author. Noteworthy is the install_requires as we add here the modules which are needed to install the module. This way, all transitive dependencies are installed along with our module, which makes it a powerful mechanism. 

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(name='myproject',
      version='0.1.0',
      author='Jens Laufer',
      author_email='jenslaufer@jenslaufer.com',
      install_requires=[],
      packages=find_packages()
      )
```

In the folder with the module files is an empty __init.py__, which is needed to install the package in a python environment before version 3.3. We can leave it out otherwise.





For local development, we got the problem that by moving the modules to a separate folder our modules can't be found anymore. We need to set the sys.path to the directory where our modules are located to fix this problem.

```python
import sys
sys.path.append("../modules/myproject")
```
Our module looks at the end like this:

![Juypter Notebook with the module loaded from local filesystem](../assets/img/jupyter_external_module_from_local.png)

We have another powerful option to install the module. We can install it with pip directly from the git repository. Our Git repository is as well our python package repository. All transitive dependencies are installed with the module.

Installing a python package from a public GitHub repository can be done like this:

```shell
pip install -U git+https://github.com/jenslaufer/myproject.git
```

In a Jupyter notebook the installation looks like this:

## Advantages

By packaging code in modules and putting it in its own Git repository we get several advantages:

- Easy use of package

  We can easily reuse the package in multiple notebooks or different environments.

- Smoother to ship code with Docker

  We can put our package dependency into a requirements file and install it when we build the container.
 
- Colab usage

  We all love Colab, as we get GPU power for free. We can install our 

- Unit testing

  We cannot write unit tests for code in Jupyter notebooks. However, for some code unit tests are essential as it saves us time for debugging. 

- Usage of IDE for module code

  IDEs offer much functionality that Jupyter does not offer e.g. code completion, linting, code formatting. By putting the code into module packages, we can use
  an IDE again

- Increased readability of notebooks

  Our notebooks are cleaner and more readable by moving our code to modules.
