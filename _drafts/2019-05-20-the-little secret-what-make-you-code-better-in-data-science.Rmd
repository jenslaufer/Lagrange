```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F,
                      message = F,

Lately I had to develop a model for a client. We all know how it is, you under pressure to get the things right and be fast. You craft some Jupyter notebooks to explore the data and to clean it. You build models, go back and forward, move from one to another Notebook and copy code. Sooner or later you end up in a mess. While I am not so experienced with data science, I have 20 years of experience in software engineering in Java. I felt embarrassed with my working style, because from the perspectitive of my inner software engineer that working style is completely unacceptable. Copy and pasting code is one of the worst you can think of. I gave me day a to review my code and to clean the code. My main mistake was misusing Jupyter Notebooks as an IDE.  Code in Notebooks which is difficult to maintain and track instead of using what notebooks are actually for taking notes with some code to get, prepare and present data. Basically you need to reduce the code in the notebooks to the bare minimum. This makes the notebooks clearer. There was that one little thing we all know that helped me out and let my code shine again:

## 1. What is a module?

## 2. What is a package?

## 3. How to create installable packages on Git

## 4. Advantages

- Easier to ship your code with Docker
- Easier to move from local coding to Colab
- Code can be unit tested
