### Inbound (Consuming)

#### Healthy nutrition

Healthy Nutrition keeps my mind and body fit. Nutrition is __drinking__ and __eating__.

##### Drinking

The goal for me is to drink __2.4l just water__. To track my drinking I am using my 0.8l water bottle, so I must finish 3 bottles.

I love coffee. Coffee is fun for me. 

All other fun drinks like Coke, Lemonade, Beer and Wine I want to ban from my live.

##### Eating

Raw foods are the most important food as they contain high levels of nutrients like vitamins.

I eat __5 kinds of fruits__ and __5 kinds of fresh vegetables__ a day.

Sugar is bad for the body and mind. Therefore I want to avoid sugar.

Processed food contains sugar, dyes, low quality fats, these are the reasons why I avoid it.

##### Reading

Reading is food for the mind. I am __reading at least 25 minutes every day__ to keep my mind healthy. Reading is to learn, to relax and for inspiration.

### Outbound (Producing)

#### Writing

I __write and publish at least 25 minutes every day__ articles on blogs to promote my businesses and brands. One of these brands is my personal brand as a software developer and data scientist.

In case of a business idea the first step is always to setup a website with a blog to write articles about the topic. The article writing helps to structure ideas and concepts; I can collect email addresses for __community building__. One way to distinguish myself from other writers is the ability to tell data stories with visualizations.

Other form of writings:

- Data Journalism
- Landing Pages

#### Products

While building up a community with blogs I create products to earn money. The simplest products are affiliate links. I can always publish book reviews. Other simple first generation products are ads.

Second generation products could be simple data reports with scraped data.

Higher level products are software application. I must keep avoid high level products in the early stage.

##### Programming

Software development is my core skill, as I have over 20 years of experience with it. Therefore I want to constantly produce software and tools. I need software to get insights from data and to automate tasks.

Software development as a freelancer is my main form of income.

My software skills cover different programming languages with different scopes:

- R
  
  Data Analysis & Data Visualization

- Python

  Scraping, Machine Learning, Deep Learning

- Java

  General purpose programming, Microservices

- Javascript

  Frontend

## Social Live

A wrong assumption is that I think I don't need other people in live. However, when I am alone I feel
lonely. I like to talk to my family and to friends. I need a __balance with being on my own and being with others__. 

I need more __quality time with my family__. Sometimes I am bored with the kids, because of the lack of intellitual input. Instead of spending more time with them I should rather look for quality time like playing games, handicrafting,
 doing excursions.

## Misc

I want to live minimalistic life with less belongings. 

## Financial

I want to be financial independent. I am financial independent with a net income of 3000 â‚¬/month. I don't want to trade time for money to accomplish this.

## Habits

To live the live I want I have habits and routines. Everything you do in life needs willpower and the amount of willpower is limited a day. Habits are performed automatically without too much willpower on the other hand. Therefore I have these daily habits

- 25 minutes workout a day
- At least 25 minutes reading a day
- At least 25 minutes writing a day
- At least 25 minutes programming a day
- At least 25 minutes tidying/cleaning/decluttering

## Goals

I must concentrate on the process with powerful habits instead of goals. However, I need goals to fill some habits with content. E.g. 25 minutes of programming can be either useless programming exercise or programming a product. 

### Daily 

- Write and Publish every day to promote me or my businesses
- Program every day to gain insights with data or create a product
