# 8 Habits for a better version of you with a suprising side effect

## Let 2020 be your year and do something against the climate change without too much more effort

Happy New Year!

It's the 1st of January 2020 and time to change your life for better and bring all your new resolutions into reality. I am sure you want to do more sports,
eat better, lose weight, drink more water. There are many things we can do to become a better version of you. The problem with new years resolutions that they fall
apart after a few weeks.

Let's change the topic for a meoment: 2019 stands without doubt for Friday for Futures and Greta Thunberg. That young lady showed us in every moment that the climate change is real
and we have to take action, leaving a bad conscius with us. Don't stop reading now, because you don't want to have these bad feelings again or you don't believe
in the climate change at all. This aticle is about improving yourself with habits that will become you best version of yourself with the side effect that they are
great for the climate.

Let's get back to the climate change for a moment: Everybody talks about how less the government and industry are doing against the
climate change. I have the feeling too many people are doing fingerpointing and bitch about Trump and Chinese, the car industry and
whatever. In the meantime most people sits on their couches and praise brave Greta for her courage while opening another beer and a pack
of chocolates. The next morning people will drive 50 km to their well paid job. The job that pays the bills for the house they bought lately.
The car is a SUV, although we don't like this kind of cars, but what can we do about it, the company is paying for the car. Last week they enjoyed
ton of food, although we had the feeling is bad for us. But it was Christmas, maybe the best time of the year. Instead of bitch about everybody else everbody
has a it's own footprint on the climate. Now I am also start to do fingerpointing on everybody else.

There is one problem that let new years resolutions fallig apart within a few weeks and taking action on the climate change has in common:

**We are human beings, that don't get out our damnd ass up**

A problem everybody has, I am pretty sure even Greta. I am pretty sure many pupils running to
these demonstration enjoyed one and another double chocolate cheesecake on Christmas. Remember that this cheesecake is need ed for you nutrition andd
it's bad for the climate and put up your weight. I am pretty sure that one and another will take a job offer from a company and will enjoy the fancy car they will get.
In the meantime they feel bad that they are do less and less sports.
Yes, you caught me again on fingerpointing.

However, maybe you give nothing about climate change, this article is also about you.
