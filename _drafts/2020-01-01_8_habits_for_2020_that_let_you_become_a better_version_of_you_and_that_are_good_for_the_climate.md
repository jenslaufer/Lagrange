# 8 Habits for a better version of you with a suprising side effect

## Let 2020 be your year and do something against the climate change without too much more effort

Happy New Year!

It's the 1st of January 2020 and time for resultions for the new year. I am sure you want to do more sports,
eat better, lose weight, drink more water. There are so many things we can do to become a better version of you.

2019 was without doubt the of Friday for Futures and Greta Thunberg. That young lady showed us, that climate change
is real and we have to take action. However, everybody talks about how less the government and industry are doing against the
climate change. I have the feeling too many are doing fingerpointing and bitch about Trump and Chinese, the car industry and
whatever. In the meantime everybody sits on his couch and praises brave Greta for her courage while opening another beer and a pack
of chocolates. The next morning we will drive 80 km to work, because of that well paid job that pays our bills for the house we bought lately.
The car is a SUV, although we don't like this kind of cars, but what can we do about it, the company is paying for the car. Last week they enjoyed
ton of food, although we had the feeling is bad for us. But it was Christmas, maybe the best time of the year. Instead of bitch about everybody else everbody
has a it's footprint on the climate.
Now I am also start to do fingerpointing on everybody else.

There is one problem that let new years resolutions fallig apart within a few weeks and taking action on the climate change has in common:
We are human beings, that don't get out our ass up. A problem everybody has, I am pretty sure even Greta. I am pretty sure many pupils running to
these demonstration enjoyed one and another double choclate cheesecake on Cgristmas. Remember that this cheesecake is need ed for you nutrition andd
it's bad for the climate. I am pretty sure that one and another will take a job offer from a company and will enjoy the fancy car he will get.
Yes, you caught me on fingerpointing.

However, maybe you give nothing about climate change, this article is also about you.
