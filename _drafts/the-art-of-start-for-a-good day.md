I realized how important my daily routines are to me. I also realized that just a few parts of the routines make the day a success or not. These most impro

### Introdution

### Fill up my dehydated body with water

Immediatly after waking up I am heading for the water tap to fill my steel water bottle and empty it half.
My body is dehydrated after sleeping, therefore it's important to water it. It helps me waking up and bring me to the next energy level

### 25 minutes workout

I am having a 25minutes workout with my sling training every morning in my cellar. You may think of a nice fitness room I have there.
It's basically our heating cellar with the oil tanks. Not a very nice place and a bit cold. However this helps me to push through the workout.
After the workout I feel energized as feel every mucsle of my body. I feel happy and I am lloking forward to shower

## Cold and warm showering

After the workout I head straight to the shower having first a cold shower, the a hot one and at end again a cold shower. I just shower for 5 minutes.
Especially the cold shower reinforces the good body feeling. I feel even more energized.

## Breakfast with at least 5 types of fresh fruits

Every morning I eat at least 5 types of fresh fruits with a Chia seeds, flax seeds, almonds, nuts and sugar free chocolate powder with water. I eat as well 5 types of fresh vergatables for lunch or supper, but those are not as important as the morning fruits.
I having the breakfast before the workouts on weekends I am havining it afterwards. I have the feeling the nutrition boosts my energy levels, although I think it's also a pacebo effect, as the nutrition are not digested that fast that I can immediatly feel the effect.

## Having the breakfast with my beloved

I am having my breakfast with my wife and my two kids. People who know me, know that I like to talk. Talk a lot. And that's what I do with my wife and my kids. we like to philosophize about everything.
I really enjoy it.
