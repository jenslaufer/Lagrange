# Would I rather Python, R, in econimcs and finance than Matlab, Excel?

- Tradeoff
- Programming gives you more flexibility
- Cost: Python, R and Databases are for free
- Learning curve: Porgramming has a steeper learning curve
- job market

I would recommend to learn Python and/or R, as you are more flexible with a programming language. In the programming language you should focus on __data manipulation__ and __data visualisation__.

You l

## Data manipulation

Python: pandas. numpy
R: dplyr

## Data visualization

Python: matplotlib, seaborn
R: ggplot2

I would learn SQL in the second step, as the programming languages have everything you need for data analysis in. 

As always there is a trade-off: Learning a programming language and gain experience with it takes time. It depends as well, if you have done programming before

One final word: I am data scientist with over 20 years of programming experience. I struggle with Excel. My answer is therefore a bit biased

Learn to program is a good investment, as you can use programs to automate tasks in other fields.
